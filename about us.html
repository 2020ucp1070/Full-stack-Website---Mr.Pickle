            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Jhansi Pacchallu was started by a passionate housewife dedicated to making authentic Andhra pickles. With a tradition of over 33 years, our pickles are crafted to make each bite a delightful experience. 
                It's more than just a businessâ€”it's a tradition that brings the true taste of Andhra to every table.</p>
            <p>Our pickles are made from 100% home-made recipes with fresh, high-quality ingredients sourced from nature. Each pickle is prepared as if it were for our own family, using the finest oils to enhance the flavors.</p>
            <p>Encouraged by our customers who reminisced about their childhood memories of pickles made by their grannies, we decided to share this tradition with everyone. We also offer exotic and rare fruits and flowers, such as Thati Munjalu, Thati Tegalu, Regi Pallu, Eetha Pallu, Kale Kayalu, and Bikki Kayalu, which are reminiscent of the street vendors' delights from the past.</p>
            <p class="highlight">What We Offer:</p>
            <p>Jhansi Food prepares and delivers not just pickles, but happiness and nostalgic memories. Our products are made by experienced rural staff using farm-fresh ingredients. We strive to offer the best quality and most delicious food while upholding the highest standards of freshness, cleanliness, and sustainability. Good food is a powerful force for positive change, and we are committed to providing an exceptional experience to our customers.</p>
